# The Iron Yard Rails Engineering Prework
## Atlanta Q3 2015: Sep 21 - Dec 18

_Brit Butler (brit@theironyard.com)_

We've got
[a lot](https://dgosxlrnzhofi.cloudfront.net/custom_page_images/64/page_images/Rails_Competencies.png?1386276348)
to cover and precious little time to cover it in. You need to complete
some preliminary work so we can have a common starting point and hit
the ground running.

As much as anything, these assignments will make sure that you've got
basic familiarity with some key concepts so you don't feel lost right
out of the gate.

Importantly, this work will assure me that you:

1. can self-direct progress on technical projects
2. have been exposed to some major technologies we'll be using in class
3. can communicate difficulties and accomplishments clearly
4. have reflected on your learning style

*Note*: Point 2 is not "have internalized every nuance", but I will
expect you to at least be _familiar_ with e.g. `git` and the terminal.

## Requirements

Review and complete the tasks below by **Sep 18**. Any
deliverables should be emailed to me by then. If you have any
questions, *please email me*, I'd love to answer questions!
(Expect a little good-natured shaming if it's 24 hours before the deadline.)

You will need to sign up for Treehouse to complete some of these
tasks. Treehouse is free for 14 days (which should be more than enough
to finish the required work), and $25/month after the trial.

## Tasks

The tasks are grouped into 4 major categories:

* Text Editing
* The Command Line
* Version Control
* Programming

### Text Editing

#### Pick and Install a text editor.

However mundane it may sound, a text editor is one of the most important
tools in a developer's life. I believe that big internet fights about which
text editor is _"best"_ are pointless but picking and becoming familiar with
**a text editor** is essential. Here is a brief survey of your options:

* Sublime Text 3
  * Pros: Friendly UI, Snappy, good plugin/package ecosystem.
  * Cons: Non-free but demo only occasionally nags to upgrade/no "locked" features.
* Atom
  * Pros: Similar to Sublime but free, younger/decent plugin ecosystem.
  * Cons: Can be slow, especially to open.
* Vim
  * Pros: Ancient and very powerful modal editor, works in a terminal, free, ubiquitous.
  * Cons: Steeeeep learning curve.
* Emacs
  * Pros: Endlessly tweakable. Free, best package ecosystem, works in a terminal.
  * Cons: Endlessly tweakable, ancient/arcane, steep learning curve, temptation to fiddle, etc.

I'm an Emacs user myself, but won't be requiring it (it distracts
too much from learning to code). I'll use it in lecture and explain 
how to do the same thing in your editors as needed.

If pressed, I would say to grab SublimeText or Atom unless you're already
committed to Emacs or Vim. Sure, Sublime is $60 (or look at a nag screen forever)
but you'll need a good text editor your whole career anyway and while
popular technologies and languages change, text editors don't.

#### Type some code!

Typing code is very different than typing documents or emails.
A **lot** of time in the first weeks of programming
is spent fixing simple typing errors. Practicing *typing*
code has the added benefit of familiarizing you with Ruby syntax.

1. Whatever editor you choose, install it and spend some time getting
   comfortable with it (customizing and learning shortcuts, for instance).
   Mastering the tools you use every day will always pay dividends.
2. Work through a few Rails lessons on [Typing.io](http://typing.io).
   Getting some practice in could save you a lot of time the first few weeks of
   class.

### The Command Line

#### Basic CLI Usage

The command line will be our primary interface to the computer, and
aside from your editor, the place you will spend the most time. If you've
never opened up a terminal before, now is the time to get comfortable.

* (Optional) Install and use iTerm2 as your terminal
* Go through the Treehouse course on
  [Getting Started with the Console](http://teamtreehouse.com/library/console-foundations#getting-started-with-the-console)
* Go through the Treehouse course on
  [Users and Permissions](http://teamtreehouse.com/library/console-foundations#users-and-permissions)
* Go through the Treehouse course on
  [Environment and Redirection](http://teamtreehouse.com/library/programming/console-foundations#environment-and-redirection)
* Read and practice with
  [A Command Line Primer for Beginners](http://lifehacker.com/5633909/who-needs-a-mouse-learn-to-use-the-command-line-for-almost-anything)

### Version Control

#### Git

Git is an open source version control tool. When you're working on
with a team of 5 on a 20,000 line Rails project, it's crucial to track
the different changes to the code being made over time. Any programming
job worth having will use git or a similar tool for collaboration.

I use Git on _every_ project I work on, and this class will be no different.

Again, the objective is not to become an expert before the class, but
just to start to get comfortable with the concepts and
vocabulary. We'll continue to work with Git throughout the course and
cover some of the more advanced concerns in class.

1. Go through the Treehouse course on [Git Basics](http://teamtreehouse.com/library/git-basics)
2. Read through the "Create a Branch" section of [Git from the Inside Out](https://codewords.recurse.com/issues/two/git-from-the-inside-out).
3. (Optional) If you want to spend some more time with git,
   [Git immersion](http://gitimmersion.com/) is a great resource.

#### GitHub

GitHub is a website which hosts Git 'repositories'. We will be hosting
all of our class projects on GitHub, and it will likely be the center
of your programming world for some time to come.

While not the same as a polished resume or portfolio, your Github profile
will be scrutinized by potential employers, and it should be created with that
in mind:

1. Sign up for a GitHub account at https://github.com/ - something professional, if not exactly your name
2. Make sure to add a profile picture and your full name
3. Email me the username you choose so that I can get you added to the group we'll be using for class
4. Add an SSH Public Key to your account as explained [here](https://help.github.com/articles/generating-ssh-keys/).
5. (Optional) Check out the [GitHub Guides](https://guides.github.com/) if you want to learn how to use GitHub prior to class.

### Programming

#### HTML / CSS

Often, our Rails apps will need to produce HTML and CSS.
Unfortunately, we will not spend very much course time on these topics.
Some students will be familiar with these technologies from past experiences.

Especially if you are not, it is quite important that you familiarize
(or re-familiarize) yourself with them since our coverage in class will be brief.

1. Complete the
   [Codecademy HTML & CSS course](http://www.codecademy.com/en/tracks/web)
2. (Optional) Read through [learnlayout.com](http://learnlayout.com) to better
   understand how to do layout with CSS.

(Treehouse has some additional material that you can check out, though
it goes into more depth than I'd expect you to work through on your
own.)

This class is primarily concerned with data flow and functionality
over design, so a little bit of extra CSS experience can really help
you stand out and make your projects look significantly more polished.

#### Ruby

We'll cover Ruby from square one in class, but many of the concepts
can take repeated exposure before sinking in. So, you *really* don't
want your first exposure to be in lecture.

1. Start the
   [Codecademy Ruby course](http://www.codecademy.com/en/tracks/ruby). Work
   through at least "Arrays & Hashes", but feel free to go farther if
   you'd like.
2. (Optional) Sign up for [Exercism.io](http://exercism.io) with your new Github
   account. Work through the Ruby track as best as you can. The important thing
   here isn't to complete everything but to spend some time applying what you've
   learned.

## Reflection / Deliverables

Good job! Take a step back and reflect on where you are. Did you enjoy
any assignments in particular? Struggle with any? How are you feeling
about the upcoming class? Excited? Nervous? How do you learn best? How
can you maximize the value you get out of this course? Do you
anticipate any problems? If so, how can we work to avoid them? Where
do you want to be in 3 months? 12?

1. Write up your reflections (with your github username) and send them to me
   via email.

We'll be encouraging this sort of reflections throughout the course -
if you feel comfortable sharing publicly, this would be a good time to
start a blog and post them there.


## Feedback & Community

You will be added to hipchat and slack at the beginning of the course,
but there is not a proper forum or mailing list for discussion of work
beforehand.

In light of that, I'll be hanging out on the **Freenode**
[IRC](https://kiwiirc.com/client) network hosting an #ironyard chatroom
until the course starts. Feel free to sign on, discuss prework, ask general
questions, discuss programming issues, and just get to know me and
each other. I'll be checking messages/logs a few times a day.

If you've never used IRC before, don't worry. There's no need to install anything.
Just click the link above, select *Freenode* as the featured network on the right,
write in `#ironyard` as the Channel and pick a nickname.
